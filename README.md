# Easy-Finance
A simulation of a stock trading application in which you can buy and sell stocks with hypothetical currency and see the results. 
One can buy stocks with cash and sell them at opurtune moment. It is useful to use this simulator first before you get into the real game.

The backend was done using flask a Python framework. I choose Flask because it is a microframework and users needs to only add the neccesry features that they require unlike Django. The front uses bootstrap for layout, HTML5 and css for styling. Jinja is used as templating engine. Javascript is used for form validation and other styling purposes. 

To view this install flask in your system and run application.py from flask in your localhost.
